### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a programmer who nowadays enjoys improving agile processes and engineering culture. I contributed or created open source projects with over 3 million downloads (JSR-385, Jasmine, percircle, math.js, and others). Besides, I have the honor to be the Founder & Leader of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Utrecht-Java-User-Group">Utrecht JUG</a>. I serve JSR-385, an award-winning JSR, as an EG Member and was nominated as JCP Participant of the Year in 2019.
